                Tomb Raider is among the most successful and long-lived video game series of all time, with more than 45 million games sold since its launch 20 years ago.
                Its heroine, British adventurer and archaeologist Lara Croft, has evolved into one of the most iconic characters in pop culture, 
                let alone gaming. She has been inducted into the Walk of Game, 
                and the Guinness Book of World Records has recognized her as the "Most Successful Human Virtual Game Heroine."
                Tomb Raider has inspired major motion pictures, comic books, novels, theme park rides, toys,and scads of other merchandise.
                The first six Tomb Raider games were developed by Core Design in Derby, U.K. The franchise now belongs to the American studio Crystal Dynamics, 
                who developed Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld, as well as the first two games in the Survivor trilogy. (The third, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 
                was developed by Eidos-Montr√©al.) For an overview of the games, read on, and be sure to check out the Tomb Raider Timeline on a separate page.

                <h2 class="article-header">Development:</h2>
            <article id="introtext">
                Development of the original Tomb Raider game began in 1994; it was released two years later. 
                Its critical and commercial success prompted Core Design to develop a new game annually for the next four years, 
                which put a strain on staff. The sixth game, The Angel of Darkness, faced difficulties during development and was considered a failure at release. 
                This prompted Eidos to switch development duties to Crystal Dynamics, which has been the series' primary developer since. 
                Other developers have contributed to spin-off titles and ports of mainline entries.
                Tomb Raider games have sold over 95 million copies worldwide by 2022.
                The series has generally been met with critical acclaim, 
                and Lara Croft has become one of the most recognisable video game protagonists, 
                winning accolades and earning places on the Walk of Game and Guinness World Records. 
                However she has also been the subject of controversy due to her sex appeal being used for marketing.
